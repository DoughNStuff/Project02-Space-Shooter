#Project 2 Space Shooter

## Implementation

I have a ship that you can control and has all of the pieces it needs. I created custom sprites for the enemy, asteroids, and the spaceship. I also added music in the background.There is also a scoring system and end screen. I added in a new enemy that fires more often and moves in a different pattern.
